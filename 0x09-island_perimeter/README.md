#ðŸ§® 0x09-island_perimeter
In this challenge, we need to find the perimeter of an island represented
as a grid of 1s (land) and 0s (water). The perimeter is the total length
 of the edges that border water.

# ðŸ§®The island is described by a 2D grid, where each value represents a cell:
  - 1 represents land
 - 0 represents water

 The perimeter is calculated by counting the edges of land cells that
are adjacent to water cells (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
